Our work with Emma Slade at GSK.ai has been featured on the [GSK.ai blog](https://gsk.ai/blogs/we-have-big-data-but-which-subset-holds-the-most-information/)! This work considers the concept of *dataset distillation*, reducing the amount of data needed to train neural networks. We provably demonstrate convergence when using diffusion-based generative models to create the distilled data, and show state-of-the-art performance on very large image datasets.
